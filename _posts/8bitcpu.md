# What is it?

The ORION-1 is the 8 Bit CPU that I am making.
It is being built using 74 series logic IC's, so it is going to have a similar level of computing power to computers that were made into the 1970's.

# Schematics

I don't have any schematics right now, but when I find the time to make them, I'll post a list here.

# Parts

For the RAM Module, the parts I use are:

- 2x 74189's, each 64 bit SRAM chips
- 2x 74LS157's for selecting the MAR or the DIP switches for programming the RAM
- 74LS173 for the MAR
- 1x8 and 1x4 DIP switches for the RAM and the MAR, respectively

When I get the time, I'll add the rest of the parts here.

# Todo List

- [ ] Upgrade RAM module to 64K
- [ ] Upgrade Control Logic to support more modules
- [ ] Upgrade program counter to support 16 address bits
