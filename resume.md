# About Me

I really like to learn new things, and therefore start new projects. You can find my projects on my [GitHub account](//github.com/eoriont) but many of them aren't finished.

# Education

I haven't attended college yet, but here are some classes I have participated in.

- [Math Academy](//mathacademy.us):
  I learned AP Calculus BC and am in the process of learning Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra. Recently, I also started Differential Equations, Discrete Math, and Abstract Algebra
- [Eurisko](//eurisko.us):
  Started in the summer of 2020, I began a machine learning course, where we learn to code our own machine learning models in python (such as linear/logistic/polynomial regressors, decision trees, random forests, KNN classifiers, neural networks, etc.)

# Projects

Here are some of my personal projects.

- [GPU accelerated Newton Fractal Simulator](/newtonfractal)
- [8 Bit CPU on a breadboard](/posts/8bit-cpu)
- I am also making my own operating system, but it's too early for a blog post about it.

# Technologies that I'm Comfortable with
