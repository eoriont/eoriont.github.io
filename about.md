# About me

My name is oriont. I like to program random things, mostly games and utilities.
I have way too many projects, but the one I am working on right now is an 8 bit CPU built on breadboards.
I plan to make it run a couple games as a demonstration, where I can make an assembler and maybe even my own language to compile.

# Experience

The technologies I have experience with include:

- Javascript (NodeJS / React)
- Elixir (Phoenix)
- Java (Minecraft Modding)
- Python
- C#
- Unity
- C++
- C (Arduino)
- Ruby (Rails / Jekyll)

I'm currently learning rust by making a fat12 image driver for my custom operating system.
You can expect posts explaining more to be out soon.
I feel it is better to master a language rather than to learn a lot of languages but not be able to write good code in them.
Although, I like to learn new things, so I end up breaking that rule alot. :)
Another reason is because if I learn a new language, I'll have to update this list!
